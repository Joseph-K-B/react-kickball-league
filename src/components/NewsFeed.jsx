                    The winter league will be starting soon. Our field for the season is located just short of the peak of Mt. Hood.
                    To comply with PDX kickball leagues ADA standards we've installed an elevator through the vent of the volcano.
                    In order to access the elevator go to the gates of Moria and speak th elvish word for friend.
